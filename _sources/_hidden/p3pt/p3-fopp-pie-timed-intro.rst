Introduction to the Timed Pretest
-----------------------------------------------------

The pretest is a timed test.

* This means that you will see how much time you have at the top (in minutes) and then a start button.  Once you click the start button you will see the first question. The time will start to countdown.  If you reach 0 all your answers will be saved.
* Answer each question to the best of your ability.  You will not receive any feedback on the correctness of your answer.
* Use the "Next" button to move to the next question.  You can also click the number buttons to move to that number question.
* Once you have seen all of the questions a "Finish Exam" button will appear.  Click that button to end your exam, but only when you are done.
* Use the "Flag Question" button to highlight a question to remind yourself to come back to it later.  The number button for that question will have a orange background if you click "Flag Question".

See the video below for detailed instructions on how to start a timed exam,
move to different questions, flag a question to remind yourself to review it later,
and finish the exam.
