COMP 1000: Think Like a Computer 
==================================================

Welcome to COMP 1000 (SCI 1002 in Fall 2022)!

This is a brand new course designed to introduce people to programming, which is a fundamental skill within Computer Science. At the same time as learning about programming, we will also begin right away by thinking about people: the end users who interact with teh software you develop. And when we think about people as end users, we must think about ethics. Thus, this course combines: Programming, Interactivity, and Ethics. PIE!

This course is being taught for the first time at the University of Manitoba in Fall 2022. It is open to any student and is specifically designed for students who have not taken Grade 12 Computer Science. 

.. Here is where you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").
