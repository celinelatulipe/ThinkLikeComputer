Review with Data Science
========================

We have reached the end of this introductory programming course. This last chapter serves as a review of what you have learned, while introducing the topic of Data Science. Most of the problems you have worked with in this text, in labs and assignments have used Turtles, and some very simple games or toy calculations. That's because it is difficult to work on big complex problems when you are just starting to learn how to program. But in this final chapter, we are going to review the concepts you've learned and do so using some problems that fit under the category of Data Science. Is a field that is often considered a sub-field of computer science or a sub-field of statistics. Data is everywhere these days: think of all the information that Google or Twitter have, and think of all the information some of the genetics testing companies have. Even just think about the University and all the data is has on student pass/fail rates for various courses. Data Science is a practice where we use computation to make sense of that data. It involves at least the following steps, though often there are more steps than what is shown here.

# Formulating a question - what is it you are trying to find out?
# Collecting data - what data needs to be collected to answer the question?
# Cleaning up and formatting the data - putting the data into a format so that it can be analyzed
# Analyzing the data and interpreting the results
# Representing and communicating the results

The fourth step above is often broken out further into feature engineering, model selection, model training and model evaluation, but we won't go into that depth here. 

Python is very well known for having a number of modules that make doing Data Science work very quick and easy. In this chapter we will introduce the Pandas module and use it to do some Data Science. The purpose here is not for you to learn Pandas - that's not a requirement for introductory programming, and you won't be asked Pandas-specific questions on your final exam. Similar to learning the Turtles module, we are using Pandas here because it allows us to practice core programming concepts while doing something interesting.
