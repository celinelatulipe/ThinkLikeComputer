.. glossary::

    accumulator pattern
        A pattern where the program initializes an accumulator variable and then changes it
        during each iteration, accumulating a final result.


    Control Flow
        Also known as the **flow of execution**, the order in which a program executes. By default, the control flow is ***sequential***.


    for loop traversal (``for``)
        *Traversing* a string or a list means accessing each character in the string or item in the list, one at a time.  For example, the following for loop:

        .. sourcecode:: python

            for ix in 'Example':
                ...

        executes the body of the loop 7 times with different values of ``ix`` each time.

    index
        A variable or value used to select a member of an ordered collection, such as
        a character from a string, or an element from a list.


    loop body
        The loop body contains the statements of the program that will be iterate through upon each loop. The loop body is always indented.


    pattern
        A sequence of statements, or a style of coding something that has
        general applicability in a number of different situations.  Part of
        becoming a mature programmer is to learn and establish the
        patterns and algorithms that form your toolkit.

    range
        A function that produces a list of numbers. For example, ``range(5)``, produces a list of five
        numbers, starting with 0, ``[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]``.


    sequential flow
        The execution of a program from top to bottom, one statement at a time


    terminating condition
        A condition which stops an interation from continuing

    traverse
        To iterate through the elements of a collection, performing a similar
        operation on each.
