Disambiguating []: creation vs indexing
=======================================

Square brackets ``[]`` are used in quite a few ways in python. When you're first learning how to use them it may be 
confusing, but with practice and repetition they'll be easy to incorporate!

You have currently encountered two instances where we have used square brackets. The first is creating lists and the second 
is indexing. At first glance, creating and indexing are difficult to distinguish. However, indexing requires referencing 
an already created list while simply creating a list does not.

.. activecode:: ac9_3_1

   new_lst = []

In the code above, a new list is created using the empty brackets. Since there's nothing in it though, we can't index into it.

.. activecode:: ac9_3_2

   new_lst = ["NFLX", "AMZN", "GOOGL", "DIS", "XOM"]
   part_of_new_lst = new_lst[0]

In the code above, you'll see how, now that we have elements inside of ``new_lst``, we can index into it. 
In order to extract an element of the list, we do use ``[]``, but we first have to specify which list we are indexing. 
Imagine if there was another list in the activecode. 
How would python know which list we want to index into if we don't tell it? 
Additionally, we have to specify what element we want to extract. This belongs inside of the brakets. 

Though it may be easier to distinguish in this above activecode, below may be a bit more difficult.

.. activecode:: ac9_3_3

   lst = [0]
   n_lst = lst[0]

   print(lst)
   print(n_lst)

Here, we see a list called ``lst`` being assigned to a list with one element, zero. Then, we see how ``n_lst`` is assigned 
the value associated with the first element of lst. Despite the variable names, only one of the above variables is 
assigned to a list. Note that in this example, what sets creating apart from indexing is the reference to the list to let 
python know that you are extracting an element from another list.

.. mchoice:: question9_3_1
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: w = [a]
   :answer_b: y = a[]
   :answer_c: x = [8]
   :answer_d: t = a[0]
   :feedback_a: No, due to the way the code was written it creates a list. This list would have one element which is the value assigned to the variable a.
   :feedback_b: Though this tries to use indexing, it does not specify what element should be taken from a.
   :feedback_c: No, this is an example of creating a list.
   :feedback_d: Yes, this will using indexing to get the value of the first element of a.
   :correct: d
   :practice: T

   Which of the following correctly uses indexing? Assume that ``a`` is a list or string. Select as many as apply.
