Data Types
----------
If you are not sure what type a value is, Python has a function called
**type** which can tell you.

.. activecode:: ac2_5_1
    :nocanvas:

    print(type("Hello, World!"))
    print(type(17))
    print("Hello, World")
    print(type(3.2))


We can also use this to find out about types that we use from imported modules, like the turtle module. 

.. activecode:: ac2_5_2
    :nocanvas:

    import turtle
    win = turtle.Screen()
    tammy = turtle.Turtle()
    tammy.forward(100)
    print(type(tammy))
    print(type(win))
    

The output in the console shows that ``tammy`` is of type Turtle from the class turtle. And ``win`` is of type Screen from the class turtle.


What about values like ``"17"`` and ``"3.2"``? They look like numbers, but they
are in quotation marks like strings.

.. activecode:: ac2_5_3
    :nocanvas:

    print(type("17"))
    print(type("3.2"))

They're strings!

Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (``'``) or double
quotes (``"``), or three of each (``'''`` or ``"""``)

.. activecode:: ac2_5_4
    :nocanvas:

    print(type('This is a string.'))
    print(type("And so is this."))
    print(type("""and this."""))
    print(type('''and even this...'''))


Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in ``"Bruce's
beard"``, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside them, as in
``'The knights who say "Ni!"'``.
Strings enclosed with three occurrences of either quote symbol are called
triple quoted strings.  They can contain either single or double quotes:

.. activecode:: ac2_5_5
    :nocanvas:

    print('''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"''')


Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:

.. activecode:: ac2_5_6
    :nocanvas:

    print("""This message will span
    several lines
    of the text.""")

Python doesn't care whether you use single or double quotes or the
three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings.  Once it has parsed the text of
your program or command, the way it stores the value is identical in all cases,
and the surrounding quotes are **not** part of the value that is stored.

.. activecode:: ac2_5_7
    :nocanvas:

    print('This is a string.')
    print("""And so is this.""")

The Python language designers usually chose to surround their strings by
single quotes.  What do you think would happen if the string already contained
single quotes?

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between
groups of three digits, as in ``42,000``. This is not a legal integer in
Python, but it does mean something else, which is legal:

.. activecode:: ac2_5_8
    :nocanvas:

    print(42500)
    print(42,500)


Well, that's not what we expected at all! Because of the comma, Python chose to
treat this as a *pair* of values. In fact, a print statement can print any number of values as long
as you separate them by commas. Notice that the values are separated by spaces when they are displayed.

.. activecode:: ac2_5_9
    :nocanvas:

    print(42, 17, 56, 34, 11, 4.35, 32)
    print(3.4, "hello", 45)

Remember not to put commas or spaces in your integers, no
matter how big they are. Also revisit what we said in the previous chapter:
formal languages are strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest
change might mean something quite different from what you intended.

.. note::
   The examples in this online text describe how print works in Python 3. If you install Python 2.7 on your machine, it will work slightly differently. One difference is that print is not called as a function, so there are no parentheses around the values to be printed.

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: question2_5_1
   :answer_a: Print out the value and determine the data type based on the value printed.
   :answer_b: Use the type function.
   :answer_c: Use it in a known equation and print the result.
   :answer_d: Look at the declaration of the variable.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: You may be able to determine the data type based on the printed value, but it may also be  deceptive, like when a string prints, there are no quotes around it.
   :feedback_b: The type function will tell you the class the value belongs to.
   :feedback_c: Only numeric values can be used in equations.
   :feedback_d: In Python variables are not declared. Values, not variables, have types in Python. A variable can even take on values with different types during a program's execution.
   :practice: T

   How can you determine the type of a variable?

.. mchoice:: question2_5_2
   :answer_a: Character
   :answer_b: Integer
   :answer_c: Float
   :answer_d: String
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: It is not a single character.
   :feedback_b: The data is not numeric.
   :feedback_c: The value is not numeric with a decimal point.
   :feedback_d: Strings can be enclosed in single quotes.
   :practice: T

   What is the data type of 'this is what kind of data'?
