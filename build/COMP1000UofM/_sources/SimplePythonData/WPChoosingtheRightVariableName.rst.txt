üë©‚Äçüíª Choosing the Right Variable Name
=======================================

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to
the human readers of the program --- they help the programmer document, or
remember, what the variable is used for.  Beginning programmers sometimes think it is funny to use strange or obscene names for their variables.  This is not good practice and will not amuse your professor.  Get in the habit of using meaningful names right away.

.. caution::

    Beginners sometimes confuse "meaningful to the human readers" with
    "meaningful to the computer".  So they'll wrongly think that because
    they've called some variable ``average`` or ``pi``, it will somehow
    automagically calculate an average, or automagically associate the variable
    ``pi`` with the value 3.14159.  No! The computer doesn't attach semantic
    meaning to your variable names.

    So you'll find some instructors who deliberately don't choose meaningful
    names when they teach beginners --- not because they don't think it is a
    good habit, but because they're trying to reinforce the message that you,
    the programmer, have to write some program code to calculate the average,
    or you must write an assignment statement to give a variable the value you
    want it to have.
