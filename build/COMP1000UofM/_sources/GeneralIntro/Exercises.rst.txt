Chapter Assessment
------------------

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: assess_question1_1_1
   :answer_a: Because computers are better at solving problems.
   :answer_b: So that you don't have to solve the problem yourself. 
   :answer_c: So that you have a general solution to a problem.
   :answer_d: Because you need a set of instructions to follow.
   :feedback_a: Computers aren't necessarily better at solving problems, though often they can be quicker than humans. Additionally, algorithms can be used to solve non-computer related problems.
   :feedback_b: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions that others can follow, this isn't the best answer. By creating the algorithm, you solve a problem for yourself and others.
   :feedback_c: Yes, by creating a general solution you can then express it as a program if you choose, and then use a computer to automate the execution.
   :feedback_d: While it is beneficial to have a set of instructions as that is what an algorithm **is**, it is not **why** we would want to create one.
   :correct: c
   :practice: T
   :topics: GeneralIntro/Algorithms

   Why create an algorithm?

.. activecode:: assess_question1_1_2
    :language: python
    :autograde: unittest

    Write code to print out the phrase "Hello World".
    ~~~~

    =====

    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertIn("Hello World", self.getOutput(), "Your output should contain a phrase Hello World")

    myTests().main()
    
.. mchoice:: assess_question1_1_3
   :answer_a: nothing, there is an error
   :answer_b: Catch you later!
   :answer_c: Good-bye!
              Hope you are well.
              Hello!
   :answer_d: Hello!
              Hope you are well.
              Good-bye!
   :answer_e: Hello!
              Hope you are well.
              Good-bye!
              Catch you later!
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: There is no error in this program.
   :feedback_b: Catch you later! is a comment, as indicated by the # sign, so it won't be printed
   :feedback_c: Yes, the lines are printed in the order the Python interpreter gets to them, top to bottom.
   :feedback_d: While it might make sense to say hello before good-bye, the Python interpreter just follows instructions in order as given
   :feedback_e: No, that is not the order in which Python sees the instructions. 

   What will be output to the console when the following program is run?

   .. code-block:: python

        # print("Catch you later!")
        print("Good-bye!")
        print("Hope you are well.")
        print("Hello!")
