Global Variables in Event-Based Programs
========================================

- you might have observed that we have been editing global variables in these interactive examples
  - aren't we not supposed to do that?
- why do we have to do that?
  - event handlers can only pass in event information, they don't know about what our application is or what info is needed

- is there a way to do this better?
  - yes! object-oriented programming
