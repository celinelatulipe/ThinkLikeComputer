The Listener Loop
=================

At the end of the previous section, we advised using a for loop whenever it will be known at the beginning of the
iteration process how many times the block of code needs to be executed. Usually, in python, you will use a for loop
rather than a while loop. When is it *not* known at the beginning of the iteration how many times the code block needs
to be executed? The answer is, when it depends on something that happens during the execution.

One very common pattern is called a **listener loop**. Inside the while loop there is a function call to get user input.
The loop repeats indefinitely, until a particular input is received.

.. activecode:: ac14_3_1

   theSum = 0
   x = -1
   while (x != 0):
       x = int(input("next number to add up (enter 0 if no more numbers): "))
       theSum = theSum + x

   print(theSum)

This is just our old friend, the accumulation pattern, adding each additional output to the sum-so-far, which is stored
in a variable called theSum and reassigned to that variable on each iteration. Notice that theSum is initialized to 0.
Also notice that we had to initialize x, our variable that stores each input that the user types, before the while loop.
This is typical with while loops, and makes them a little tricky to read and write. We had to initialize it because the
condition ``x != 0`` is checked at the very beginning, before the code block is ever executed. In this case, we picked
an initial value that we knew would make the condition true, to ensure that the while loop's code block would execute at
least once.

If you're at all unsure about how that code works, try adding print statements inside the while loop that print out the
values of x and theSum.

Other uses of ``while``
------------------------------

Sentinel Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indefinite loops are much more common in the real world than definite loops.

* If you are selling tickets to an event, you don't know in advance how
  many tickets you will sell. You keep selling tickets as long as people come
  to the door and there's room in the hall.
* When the baggage crew unloads a plane, they don't know in advance how many
  suitcases there are. They just keep unloading while there are bags left in the
  cargo hold. (Why *your* suitcase is always the last one is an entirely different problem.)
* When you go through the checkout line at the grocery, the clerks don't
  know in advance how many items there are. They just keep ringing up items as
  long as there are more on the conveyor belt.

Let's implement the last of these in Python, by asking the user for prices and
keeping a running total and count of items. When the last item is entered,
the program gives the grand total, number of items, and average price.
We'll need these variables:

* ``total`` - this will start at zero
* ``count`` - the number of items, which also starts at zero
* ``moreItems`` - a boolean that tells us whether more items are waiting; this starts as True

The pseudocode (code written half in English, half in Python) for the body of the loop
looks something like this::

    while moreItems
        ask for price
        add price to total
        add one to count

This pseudocode has no option to set ``moreItems`` to ``False``, so it would run forever.
In a grocery store, there's a little
plastic bar that you put after your last item to separate your groceries from
those of the person behind you; that's how the clerk knows you have no more items.
We don't have a "little plastic bar" data type in Python, so we'll do the next best thing: we
will use a ``price`` of zero to mean "this is my last item." In this program,
zero is a **sentinel value**, a value used to signal the end of the loop. Here's the code:

.. activecode:: ac14_3_2
    :timelimit: 60000

    def checkout():
        total = 0
        count = 0
        moreItems = True
        while moreItems:
            price = float(input('Enter price of item (0 when done): '))
            if price != 0:
                count = count + 1
                total = total + price
                print('Subtotal: $', total)
            else:
                moreItems = False
        average = total / count
        print('Total items:', count)
        print('Total $', total)
        print('Average price per item: $', average)

    checkout()

There are still a few problems with this program.

* If you enter a negative number, it will be added to the total and count. Modify the code
  so that negative numbers give an error message instead (but don't end the loop) Hint: ``elif`` is
  your friend.
* If you enter zero the first time you are asked for a price, the loop will end, and the program
  will try to divide by zero. Use an ``if``/``else`` statement outside the loop to avoid the
  division by zero and tell the user that you can't compute an average without data.
* This program doesn't display the amounts to two decimal places. You'll be introduced to that in another
  chapter.

Validating Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use a ``while`` loop when you want to **validate** input;  when you want to make
sure the user has entered valid input for a prompt. Let's say you want a function
that asks a yes-or-no question. In this case, you want to make sure that the person using
your program enters either a Y for yes or N for no (in either upper or lower case).
Here is a program that uses a ``while`` loop to keep asking until it receives a valid answer.
As a preview of coming attractions, it uses
the ``upper()`` method which is described in String Methods to convert a string to upper case.
When you run the following code, try typing something other than Y or N to see how the code reacts:

.. activecode:: ac14_3_3
    :timelimit: 60000

    def get_yes_or_no(message):
        valid_input = False
        while not valid_input:
            answer = input(message)
            answer = answer.upper() # convert to upper case
            if answer == 'Y' or answer == 'N':
                valid_input = True
            else:
                print('Please enter Y for yes or N for no.')
        return answer

    response = get_yes_or_no('Do you like lima beans? Y)es or N)o: ')
    if response == 'Y':
        print('Great! They are very healthy.')
    else:
        print('Too bad. If cooked right, they are quite tasty.')
