        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">br</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>Mr. Sherlock Holmes<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h3</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,
        save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all
        night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the
        hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left
        behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,
        bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a &quot;Penang lawyer.&quot;
        Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
        across. &quot;To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
        C.C.H.,&quot; was engraved upon it, with the date &quot;1884.&quot; It was just
        such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to
        carry<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>dignified, solid, and reassuring.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Well, Watson, what do you make of it?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no
        sign of my occupation.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in
        the back of your head.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in
        front of me,&quot; said he. &quot;But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of
        our visitor&#39;s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss
        him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir
        becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an
        examination of it.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I think,&quot; said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
        companion, &quot;that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical
        man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of
        their appreciation.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Good!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Excellent!&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a
        country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on
        foot.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Why so?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has
        been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town
        practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so
        it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with
        it.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Perfectly sound!&quot; said Holmes.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;And then again, there is the &#39;friends of the C.C.H.&#39; I should
        guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose
        members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which
        has made him a small presentation in return.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Really, Watson, you excel yourself,&quot; said Holmes, pushing back
        his chair and lighting a cigarette. &quot;I am bound to say that in
        all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own
        small achievements you have habitually underrated your own
        abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you
        are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius
        have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear
        fellow, that I am very much in your debt.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words
        gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his
        indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had
        made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think
        that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way
        which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands
        and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with
        an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and
        carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a
        convex lens.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Interesting, though elementary,&quot; said he as he returned to his
        favourite corner of the settee. &quot;There are certainly one or two
        indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
        deductions.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Has anything escaped me?&quot; I asked with some self-importance. &quot;I
        trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have
        overlooked?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
        erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be
        frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided
        towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this
        instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he
        walks a good deal.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Then I was right.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;To that extent.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;But that was all.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;No, no, my dear Watson, not all<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>by no means all. I would
        suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more
        likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when
        the initials &#39;C.C.&#39; are placed before that hospital the words
        &#39;Charing Cross&#39; very naturally suggest themselves.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;You may be right.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
        working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
        construction of this unknown visitor.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Well, then, supposing that &#39;C.C.H.&#39; does stand for &#39;Charing
        Cross Hospital,&#39; what further inferences may we draw?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has
        practised in town before going to the country.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look
        at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable
        that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends
        unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the
        moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the
        hospital in order to start in practice for himself. We know there
        has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from
        a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching
        our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
        occasion of the change?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;It certainly seems probable.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff
        of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London
        practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not
        drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the
        hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a
        house-surgeon or a house-physician<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>little more than a senior
        student. And he left five years ago<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>the date is on the stick. So
        your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin
        air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under
        thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of
        a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger
        than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his
        settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,&quot; said I,
        &quot;but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars
        about the man&#39;s age and professional career.&quot; From my small
        medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the
        name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our
        visitor. I read his record aloud.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor,
        Devon. House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross
        Hospital. Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,
        with essay entitled &#39;Is Disease a Reversion?&#39; Corresponding
        member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of &#39;Some
        Freaks of Atavism&#39; (Lancet 1882). &#39;Do We Progress?&#39; (Journal of
        Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of
        Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;No mention of that local hunt, Watson,&quot; said Holmes with a
        mischievous smile, &quot;but a country doctor, as you very astutely
        observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As
        to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,
        unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is
        only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only
        an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,
        and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
        visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;And the dog?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.
        Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,
        and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog&#39;s
        jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in
        my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It
        may have been<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the
        recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his
        voice that I glanced up in surprise.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our
        very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don&#39;t move, I
        beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your
        presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment
        of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is
        walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.
        What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock
        Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had
        expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin
        man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two
        keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from
        behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a
        professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was
        dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was
        already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
        and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes
        fell upon the stick in Holmes&#39;s hand, and he ran towards it with
        an exclamation of joy. &quot;I am so very glad,&quot; said he. &quot;I was not
        sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I
        would not lose that stick for the world.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;A presentation, I see,&quot; said Holmes.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;From Charing Cross Hospital?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Dear, dear, that&#39;s bad!&quot; said Holmes, shaking his head.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Why was it bad?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your
        marriage, you say?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all
        hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home
        of my own.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,&quot; said Holmes.
        &quot;And now, Dr. James Mortimer <span class="ni">&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;</span>&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Mister, sir, Mister<span class="ni">&amp;mdash;</span>a humble M.R.C.S.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;And a man of precise mind, evidently.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the
        shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.
        Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not <span class="ni">&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;</span>&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in
        connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,
        Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or
        such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any
        objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A
        cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would
        be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my
        intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. &quot;You are
        an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am
        in mine,&quot; said he. &quot;I observe from your forefinger that you make
        your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the
        other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers
        as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the
        interest which he took in our curious companion.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I presume, sir,&quot; said he at last, &quot;that it was not merely for
        the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the
        honour to call here last night and again to-day?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of
        doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I
        recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am
        suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary
        problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest
        expert in Europe <span class="ni">&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;</span>&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?&quot;
        asked Holmes with some asperity.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur
        Bertillon must always appeal strongly.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Then had you not better consult him?&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a
        practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.
        I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently <span class="ni">&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;</span>&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>&quot;Just a little,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would
        do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly
        what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my
        assistance.&quot;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
