The ``in`` and ``not in`` operators
-----------------------------------

The ``in`` operator tests if one string is a substring of another:

.. activecode:: ac6_4_1
    
    print('p' in 'apple')
    print('i' in 'apple')
    print('ap' in 'apple')
    print('pa' in 'apple')

Note that a string is a substring of itself, and the empty string is a 
substring of any other string. (Also note that computer scientists 
like to think about these edge cases quite carefully!) 

.. activecode:: ac6_4_2
    
    print('a' in 'a')
    print('apple' in 'apple')
    print('' in 'a')
    print('' in 'apple')
    
The ``not in`` operator returns the logical opposite result of ``in``.

.. activecode:: ac6_4_3

    print('x' not in 'apple')

We can also use the ``in`` and ``not in`` operators on lists!

.. activecode:: ac4_4_4

   print("a" in ["a", "b", "c", "d"])
   print(9 in [3, 2, 9, 10, 9.0])
   print('wow' not in ['gee wiz', 'gosh golly', 'wow', 'amazing'])

However, remember how you were able to check to see if an "a" was in "apple"? 
Let's try that again to see if there's an "a" somewhere in the following list.

.. activecode:: ac6_4_5

    print("a" in ["apple", "absolutely", "application", "nope"])

Clearly, we can tell that a is in the word apple, and absolutely, and application. For some reason 
though, the Python interpreter returns False. Why is that? When we use the ``in`` and ``not in`` 
operators on lists, Python checks to see if the item on the left side of the expression is equivalent 
to an element in the item on the right side of the expression. In this case, Python is checking 
whether or not an element of the list is the string "a" - nothing more or less than that.
