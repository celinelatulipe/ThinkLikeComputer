COMP 1000: Think Like a Computer 
==================================================

Welcome to COMP 1000!

This course is designed to introduce people to programming, which is a fundamental skill within Computer Science. This text is called 'Think Like a Computer' because the goal is for you to think through and understand how a computer will run the lines of code in a program, whether it's a program you wrote or a program someone else wrote. At the same time as learning about programming and how to think like a computer, we will also begin right away by thinking about people: the end users who *interact* with the programs you write. And when we think about people as end users, we must think about *ethics*, because when people interact with computers both good and bad things can result, and it's our responsibility to consider these possibilities. Thus, this course combines Programming, Interactivity, and Ethics: PIE!


.. Here is where you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").
