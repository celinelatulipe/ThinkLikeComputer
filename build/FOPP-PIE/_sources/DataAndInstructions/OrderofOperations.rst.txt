Order of Operations
-------------------

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation
depends on the **rules of precedence**. Python follows the same precedence
rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does.

.. The acronym PEMDAS
.. is a useful way to remember the order of operations:

#. *Parentheses* have the highest precedence and can be used to force an
   expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in
   parentheses are evaluated first, ``2 * (3-1)`` is 4, and ``(1+1)**(5-2)`` is
   8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in
   ``(minute * 100) / 60``: in this case, the parentheses don't change the result,
   but they reinforce that the expression in parentheses will be evaluated first.
#. *Exponentiation* has the next highest precedence, so ``2**1+1`` is 3 and
   not 4, and ``3*1**3`` is 3 and not 27.  Can you explain why?
#. *Multiplication and both division* operators have the same
   precedence, which is higher than addition and subtraction, which
   also have the same precedence. So ``2*3-1`` yields 5 rather than 4, and
   ``5-2*2`` is 1, not 6.
#. Operators with the *same* precedence are
   evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra we say they are *left-associative*.
   So in the expression ``6-3+2``, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3.
   We then add 2 to get the result 5. If the operations had been evaluated from
   right to left, the result would have been ``6-(3+2)``, which is 1.

.. (The
..   acronym PEDMAS could mislead you to thinking that division has higher
..   precedence than multiplication, and addition is done ahead of subtraction -
..   don't be misled.  Subtraction and addition are at the same precedence, and
..   the left-to-right rule applies.)

.. note::

    Due to some historical quirk, an exception to the left-to-right
    left-associative rule is the exponentiation operator ``**``. A useful hint
    is to always use parentheses to force exactly the order you want when
    exponentiation is involved:

.. activecode:: ac2_11_1
   :nocanvas:

   print(2 ** 3 ** 2)     # the right-most ** operator gets done first!
   print((2 ** 3) ** 2)   # use parentheses to force the order you want!

.. note::

   This is a second way that parentheses are used in Python. The first way you've already seen is that () indicates a function call, with the inputs going inside the parentheses. How can Python tell when parentheses specify to call a function, and when they are just forcing the order of operations for ambiguous operator expressions? 
   
   The answer is that if there's a a function to the left of the parentheses, then the parentheses indicate a function call, and otherwise not.

   :feedback_a: Using parentheses, the expression is evaluated as (2*5) first, then (10 // 3), then (16-3), and then (13+1).
   :feedback_b: Remember that * has precedence over  -.
   :feedback_c: Remember that // has precedence over -.
   :feedback_d: Remember that // does integer division.

   What is the value of the following expression:

   .. code-block:: python

      16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1

Here is an animation for the above expression:

.. showeval:: se_ac2_11_1
   :trace_mode: true

   16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1
   ~~~~
   16 - {{2 * 5}}{{10}} // 3 + 1
   16 - {{10 // 3}}{{3}} + 1
   {{16 - 3}}{{13}} + 1
   {{13 + 1}}{{14}}
