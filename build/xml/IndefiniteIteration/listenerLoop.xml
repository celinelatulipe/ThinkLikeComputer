        <title>The Input Listener Loop</title>
        <paragraph>At the end of the previous section, we advised using a for loop whenever it will be known at the beginning of the
            iteration process how many times the block of code needs to be executed. Usually, in Python, you will use a for loop
            rather than a while loop. When is it <emphasis>not</emphasis> known at the beginning of the iteration how many times the code block needs
            to be executed? The answer is, when it depends on something that happens <strong>during</strong> the execution.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>One very common pattern is called a <strong>listener loop</strong>. Inside the while loop there is a function call to get user input.
            The loop repeats indefinitely, until a particular input is received.</paragraph>

    <program label="ac10_3_1" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
theSum = 0
x = -1
while (x != 0):
    x = int(input("next number to add up (enter 0 if no more numbers): "))
    theSum = theSum + x

print(theSum)
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
        <paragraph>This is just our old friend, the accumulation pattern, adding each additional output to the sum-so-far, which is stored
            in a variable called theSum and reassigned to that variable on each iteration. Notice that theSum is initialized to 0.
            Also notice that we had to initialize x, our variable that stores each input that the user types, before the while loop.
            This is typical with while loops, and makes them a little tricky to read and write. We had to initialize it because the
            condition <literal>x != 0</literal> is checked at the very beginning, before the code block is ever executed. In this case, we picked
            an initial value that we knew would make the condition true, to ensure that the while loop’s code block would execute at
            least once.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>If you’re at all unsure about how that code works, try adding print statements inside the while loop that print out the
            values of x and theSum.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>You’ve seen a related example to this with our interactive turtle programs that have listener functions:</paragraph>

    <program label="ac10_3_2" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
import turtle
import random

def random_square(tur):
    """ Post-Condition: square with random small size
        is drawn at turtle's current location """
    side = random.randrange(10, 30) # get random size
    for _ in range(4): #draw a square in location
        tur.forward(side)
        tur.left(90)
    return tur

def random_location(tur):
    """ Post-Condition: turtle is moved to a random location on canvas
        Pre-conditions: Assume canvas is 400 x 400 """
    x = random.randrange(-200, 200) # get random x location
    y = random.randrange(-200, 200) # get random y location
    tur.penup()
    tur.goto(x,y) # move to location without drawing
    tur.pendown()
    return tur

def random_colour(tur):
    """ Post-Condition: turtle is a random colour """
    tur.color(random.random(), random.random(), random.random())
    return tur

def key_r():
    """ draw randomly coloured and positioned square """
    global alex
    alex = random_colour(alex)
    alex = random_location(alex)
    alex = random_square(alex)

def key_q():
    """ close the canvas window """
    wn.bye()

def click(x, y):
    """ go to clicked location, pick random color and draw square """
    global alex
    alex.penup()
    alex.goto(x, y)
    alex.pendown()
    alex = random_colour(alex)
    alex = random_square(alex)

wn = turtle.Screen()      # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # create alex
alex.speed(10)            # make alex draw fast
alex = random_colour(alex)
alex = random_location(alex)
alex = random_square(alex)

wn.onkey(key_r, 'r')    # tell the operating system to execute function 'key_r()' when the 'r' key is pressed on the keyboard
wn.onkey(key_q, 'q')    # tell the operating system to execute function 'key_q()' when the 'q' key is pressed on the keyboard
wn.onclick(click)       # tell the operating system to execute function 'click' when the user clicks the mouse
wn.listen()             # tell the operating system to listen for events on the canvas window
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
        <paragraph>In this turtle example, the last line of the code is wn.listen(). This allows us to rely on the built-in event loop that the turtle module provides. We don’t have to write the listening loop ourselves, we just tell the turtle module what events we want to listen for (the three lines of code right before the last line). The turtle graphics module will just listen for these events, in a loop, until we quit, which causes the canvas to be destroyed and the main event loop ends.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If you are selling tickets to an event, you don’t know in advance how
                            many tickets you will sell. You keep selling tickets as long as people come

                        <paragraph>When the baggage crew unloads a plane, they don’t know in advance how many
                            suitcases there are. They just keep unloading while there are bags left in the
                            cargo hold. (Why <emphasis>your</emphasis> suitcase is always the last one is an entirely different problem.)</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>When you go through the checkout line at the grocery, the clerks don’t
                            know in advance how many items there are. They just keep ringing up items as
                            long as there are more on the conveyor belt.</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                </bullet_list>
                <paragraph>Let’s implement the last of these in Python, by asking the user for prices and
                    keeping a running total and count of items. When the last item is entered,
                    the program gives the grand total, number of items, and average price.
                    We’ll need these variables:</paragraph>
                <bullet_list bullet="*">
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph><literal>total</literal> - this will start at zero</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph><literal>count</literal> - the number of items, which also starts at zero</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph><literal>moreItems</literal> - a boolean that tells us whether more items are waiting; this starts as True</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                </bullet_list>
                <paragraph>The pseudocode (code written half in English, half in Python) for the body of the loop
                    looks something like this:</paragraph>
                <literal_block force="False" language="default" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">while moreItems
    ask for price
    add price to total
    add one to count</literal_block>
                <paragraph>This pseudocode has no option to set <literal>moreItems</literal> to <literal>False</literal>, so it would run forever.
                    In a grocery store, there’s a little
                    plastic bar that you put after your last item to separate your groceries from
                    those of the person behind you; that’s how the clerk knows you have no more items.
                    We don’t have a “little plastic bar” data type in Python, so we’ll do the next best thing: we
                    will use a <literal>price</literal> of zero to mean “this is my last item.” In this program,
                    zero is a <strong>sentinel value</strong>, a value used to signal the end of the loop. Here’s the code:</paragraph>

    <program label="ac10_3_3" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
def checkout():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    moreItems = True
    while moreItems:
        price = float(input('Enter price of item (0 when done): '))
        if price != 0:
            count = count + 1
            total = total + price
            print('Subtotal: $', total)
        else:
            moreItems = False
    average = total / count
    print('Total items:', count)
    print('Total $', total)
    print('Average price per item: $', average)

checkout()
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
                <paragraph>There are still a few problems with this program.</paragraph>
                <bullet_list bullet="*">
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>If you enter a negative number, it will be added to the total and count. Modify the code
                            so that negative numbers give an error message instead (but don’t end the loop) Hint: <literal>elif</literal> is
                            your friend.</paragraph>
                    </list_item>
                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph>If you enter zero the first time you are asked for a price, the loop will end, and the program
                            will try to divide by zero. Use an <literal>if</literal>/<literal>else</literal> statement outside the loop to avoid the
                            division by zero and tell the user that you can’t compute an average without data.</paragraph>

            <section ids="validating-input" names="validating\ input">
                <title>Validating Input</title>
                <paragraph>You can also use a <literal>while</literal> loop when you want to <strong>validate</strong> input;  when you want to make
                    sure the user has entered valid input for a prompt. Let’s say you want a function
                    that asks a yes-or-no question. In this case, you want to make sure that the person using
                    your program enters either a Y for yes or N for no (in either upper or lower case).
                    Here is a program that uses a <literal>while</literal> loop to keep asking until it receives a valid answer.
                    When you run the following code, try typing something other than Y or N to see how the code reacts:</paragraph>

    <program label="ac10_3_4" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
def get_yes_or_no(message):
    valid_input = False
    while not valid_input:
        answer = input(message)
        answer = answer.upper() # convert to upper case
        if answer == 'Y' or answer == 'N':
            valid_input = True
        else:
            print('Please enter Y for yes or N for no.')
    return answer

response = get_yes_or_no('Do you like lima beans? Y)es or N)o: ')
if response == 'Y':
    print('Great! They are very healthy.')
else:
    print('Too bad. If cooked right, they are quite tasty.')
