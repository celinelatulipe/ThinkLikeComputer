            <title>Project Title: An analysis of innovative practice types in introductory programming classes</title>
            <paragraph><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>:  We would like to ask your permission to be part of a multi-intuitional research study on innovative practice types in introductory programming classes. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effectiveness of different types of practice problems compared to writing code from scratch in introductory programming courses. Your participation will be to complete assignments in your interactive e-book where your interaction data will be automatically recorded. You will also be asked to complete surveys. After the CS 111 course has completed and final grades have been submitted to the registrar, and if you have given permission below, your e-book data and survey data will be analyzed. We will also use your demographic data from the registrar, grades on midterms and final course grade in our analysis. If you do not give consent, your data will be removed before any data is analyzed. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits. At no time will any identifying data about you be shared. You can also volunteer below to do a think-aloud observation in which you solve problems while you talk about what you are doing and why. Participation in the observations is voluntary. Your grade in the CS 111 course will not be affected by your decision on either consent or observation. However, failure to complete the assignent itself will affect your grade.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT</strong>:  Your participation will take approximately 50 minutes.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS</strong>:  This research study is expected to involve minimal risk. The risk of being part of this study is no greater than those involved in existing daily practices, including going to school. However, a breach of confidentiality is a risk common to this type of research. Safeguards to minimize this risk include replacing your identifiable information (name or username) with a code before data is analyzed. The document that links the codes to your name or username will be encrypted and stored on a password-protected system. All observations will be audio recorded, but any identifiers will be removed from the audio transcript and then the audio file will be destroyed. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study, but you may be provided with educational benefits through participation in the study. Your participation may also result in the benefit of increased public understanding of the effectiveness of new practice types for future students learning programming because significant new findings developed during the research will be published and the results read by other lecturers.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>INCENTIVES</strong>:  There is no incentive or compensation for participating in this study.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>PROTECTION OF PARTICIPANT’S DATA</strong>:  Your privacy will be protected and research records will be confidential. The following procedures are designed to protect your data from unauthorized access or inappropriate use: All identifiable data will be destroyed five years after we stop gathering data for this study and have disseminated the findings from the research. Identifiers will be removed from the identifiable private information and after such removal; the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject.
                Only researchers will have access to your data and that data will be stored on a password-protected system. All identifiable information (name/username) will be replaced with a code before the data is analyzed. The document that links the code to your name/username will be encrypted and stored on a password protected system.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><strong>PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS</strong>:  If you have read this form and you agree to be part of this study, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  In other words, you are free to be part of this activity and you are free to stop at any moment during the activity. The alternative is not to participate. You do not have to participate in the think-aloud observations. Your grade is the CS 111 course will not be affected in any way by your decision on consent or on observation. The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.  Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.</paragraph>
