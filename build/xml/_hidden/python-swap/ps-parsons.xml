        <paragraph>Please answer
            the following problems to the best of your ability without any
            outside help. You can stop working on a problem after you have worked
            on it for about five minutes without solving it.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The following has the correct code to ‘swap’ the values in x and y (so that x ends up with y’s initial value and y ends up with x’s initial value), but the code is mixed up and contains one extra block which is not needed in a correct solution.  Drag the needed blocks from the left into the correct order on the right. Check your solution by clicking on the Check button.  You will be told if any of the blocks are in the wrong order or if you need to remove one or more blocks.  After three incorrect attempts you will be able to use the Help Me button to make the problem easier.</paragraph>
