        <title>Combining Iterations and Functions</title>
        <paragraph>In this section, we will talk about when to use iteration (for loops) vs. when to use functions. We will also look at examples where:</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="*">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>Inside an iterating for loop, we invoke a function</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>Inside a function, we use iteration</paragraph>
            </list_item>
        </bullet_list>
        <section ids="code-re-use" names="code\ re-use">
            <title>Code Re-Use</title>
            <paragraph>Both functions and iteration are ways to avoid typing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again. This is important because if you have similar lines of code and you discover a bug in one of them, or decide to make a change, you have to make that change in all of them. Whenever you are writing code, if you find yourself writing the same (or very similar) lines of code over and over again, you can probably simplify your code, either by putting that code into a function, or by putting that code inside a loop.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>So, if you need to do something multiple times, should you put the code in a loop or in a function? Here are a few ways to think about this:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="*">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>if the code performs a specific, well-defined task, it should likely go in a function.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>if the code may need to be reused at different times, or called from different places in your program, it should likely go in a function</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>If the code needs to be repeated (over and over again at the same time) across a range of values that change, you probably need a loop in order to step through that range of values. The values might be a numerical range, the items in a list or the characters in a string. In any of these cases you likely need a loop.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>

        <section ids="invoking-functions-inside-loops" names="invoking\ functions\ inside\ loops">
            <title>Invoking Functions Inside Loops</title>
            <paragraph>A common pattern is to have a loop that iterates through a set of values (a range of numbers, a list of items or the characters in a string), and for each item in that set, call a function to do something. That looks like this:</paragraph>
            <image align="center" candidates="{'*': 'IntegrationPause/Figures/function_inside_loop.png'}" uri="IntegrationPause/Figures/function_inside_loop.png" width="400"></image>
            <paragraph>Remember that to follow Python conventions, we want to declare functions at the top of the script. Then we can call the functions anywhere else in the program, including inside of loops.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Here is an example of this:</paragraph>

    <program label="ac7_2_1" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
def cube_input():
    input_string = input("Enter a number:")
    input_num = int(input_string)
    cube = input_num**3
    print("You entered: ", input_string, ". If you cube it, you get: ", cube)


for index in range(5):
    print("Round #", index)
    cube_input()


print("That's it. All done.")
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
            <paragraph>That’s not a very exciting example, but it demonstrates a few things:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="*">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>giving functions meaninful names - the function gets input and cubes it</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>not repeating code - the function is called five times from inside a loop. The function is only four lines of code, but if it was repeated five times, it would be 20 lines of code. The code inside the function doesn’t know the round number. It doesn’t need to.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>use of the exponent operator ( ** )</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>using variable names that contain the type, to avoid confusion (input_string and input_num).</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>Let’s look at a turtle example, with a few different functions called from inside a loop.</paragraph>
