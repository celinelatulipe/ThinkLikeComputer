        <title>Contributor List</title>
        <paragraph>To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this book is free
            like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It came about
            because of a collaboration that would not have been possible without the GNU
            Free Documentation License. So we would like to thank the Free Software
            Foundation for developing this license and, of course, making it available to
            us.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We would also like to thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers
            who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few years. In the
            spirit of free software, we decided to express our gratitude in the form of a
            contributor list.  Unfortunately, this list is not complete, but we are doing
            our best to keep it up to date. It was also getting too large to include
            everyone who sends in a typo or two. You have our gratitude, and you have the
            personal satisfaction of making a book you found useful better for you and
            everyone else who uses it. New additions to the list for the 2nd edition will
            be those who have made on-going contributions.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>If you have a chance to look through the list, you should realize that each
            person here has spared you and all subsequent readers from the confusion of a
            technical error or a less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a
            note.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still be errors
            in this book. If you should stumble across one, we hope you will take a minute
            to contact us. The email address is <reference name="jeff@elkner.net" refuri="mailto:jeff@elkner.net">jeff@elkner.net</reference>
            . Substantial changes made due to your suggestions will add you to the next
            version of the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). Thank you!</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The edits to this PIE edition have been made mainly by Celine Latulipe at the University of Manitoba.
                Some of the ethics content was added by Lauren Himbeault, an MSc student advised by Celine Latulipe. Some
                questions and exercises were suggested by Carter Lupkowski, an undergraduate CS student working with
