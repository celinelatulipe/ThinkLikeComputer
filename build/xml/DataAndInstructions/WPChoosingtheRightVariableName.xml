        <title>üë©‚Äçüíª Choosing the Right Variable Name</title>
        <paragraph>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to
            the human readers of the program ‚Äî they help the programmer document, or
            remember, what the variable is used for.  Beginning programmers sometimes think it is funny to use strange or obscene names for their variables.  This is not good practice and will not amuse your professor.  Get in the habit of using meaningful names right away.</paragraph>
        <caution>
            <paragraph>Beginners sometimes confuse ‚Äúmeaningful to the human readers‚Äù with
                ‚Äúmeaningful to the computer‚Äù.  So they‚Äôll wrongly think that because
                they‚Äôve called some variable <literal>average</literal> or <literal>pi</literal>, it will somehow
                automagically calculate an average, or automagically associate the variable
                <literal>pi</literal> with the value 3.14159.  No! The computer doesn‚Äôt attach semantic
                meaning to your variable names.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>So you‚Äôll find some instructors who deliberately don‚Äôt choose meaningful
                names when they teach beginners ‚Äî not because they don‚Äôt think it is a
                good habit, but because they‚Äôre trying to reinforce the message that you,
                the programmer, have to write some program code to calculate the average,
                or you must write an assignment statement to give a variable the value you
                want it to have.</paragraph>
        </caution>
