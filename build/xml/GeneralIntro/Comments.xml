        <title>Comments</title>
        <paragraph>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read.
            Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.
            For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called comments.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A <strong>comment</strong> in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human
            reader (the programmer)  - it is completely ignored by the interpreter.
            In Python, the <literal>#</literal> token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored.
            Here is a new version of <emphasis>Hello, World!</emphasis>.</paragraph>

# This demo program shows off how elegant Python is!

print("Hello, World!")     # Isn't this easy!
        </input>

</tests>

    </program>
        <paragraph>Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the phrase Hello, World!  None of the comments appear.
            You‚Äôll also notice that we‚Äôve left a blank line in the program.  Blank lines
            are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your
            programs much easier for humans to parse.  Use them liberally!üë©‚Äçüíª Ease of writing is not as important as ease of reading. You will thank yourself later if you write these comments as you program.</paragraph>
