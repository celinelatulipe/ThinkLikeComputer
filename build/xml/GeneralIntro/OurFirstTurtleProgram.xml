        <title>üê¢ Our First Turtle Program</title>
        <paragraph>Let‚Äôs try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and
            start drawing a simple figure like a rectangle.
            We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name antara, but remember that you can
            choose any name you wish as long as you follow the naming rules from the previous chapter.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle.
            After line 4 you will have a straight line going from the center of the
            drawing canvas towards the right. After line 6, you will have a canvas with a
            turtle and a half drawn rectangle. Press the run button to try it and see.</paragraph>

    <program label="ac_turtle_rectangle_tour" interactive='activecode' language="python">
    
        <input>
import turtle             # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()      # creates a graphics window
antara = turtle.Turtle()    # create a turtle named antara
antara.forward(150)         # tell antara to move forward by 150 units
antara.left(90)             # turn by 90 degrees
antara.forward(75)          # complete the second side of a rectangle
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
        <paragraph>Here are a couple of things you‚Äôll need to understand about this program.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The first line tells Python to load a <strong>module</strong> named <literal>turtle</literal>. You will learn about modules in a later chapter, for now you can think of a module as an external library of code that is available to use.
            Using the turtle module allows us to easily get a window up on screen and a turtle that can be used to draw pictures in that window. There are lots of details in this code that we will explain more later, for now, here is a brief explanation:</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Line 2 creates a window, which has a name ‚Äòwn‚Äô.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Line 3 creates a turtle, which has a name ‚Äòantara‚Äô.</paragraph>
        <comment xml:space="preserve">brings us two new types that we can use: the ``Turtle`` type, and the
``Screen`` type.  The dot notation ``turtle.Turtle`` means *"The Turtle type
that is defined within the turtle module"*. (Remember that Python is case
sensitive, so the module name, ``turtle``, with a lowercase ``t``, is different from the
type ``Turtle`` because of the uppercase ``T``.)

We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would
prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python
simply a canvas), which we assign to variable ``wn``. Every window
contains a **canvas**, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.

In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable ``antara`` is made to refer to this
turtle.</comment>
        <paragraph>These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In lines 4-6, we instruct the turtle ‚Äòantara‚Äô to move and to turn. antara the turtle is an <strong>object</strong> and has things it can do.
            The antara.&lt;action&gt;(&lt;info&gt;) notation, tells Python that the turtle antara should do certain things (move forward, turn left) and
            the information in the brackets gives details on how to do those things (how far to move, how much to turn).</paragraph>
        <comment xml:space="preserve">We do this by **invoking** or activating antara's **methods** --- these are the instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.</comment>

            <title>Complete the rectangle ‚Ä¶</title>
            <paragraph>Modify the program by adding the commands necessary to have <emphasis>antara</emphasis> complete the

        <paragraph><strong>Mixed up programs</strong>
            Throughout this textbook, you‚Äôll see many examples of ‚ÄòMixed up programs‚Äô like the one below. These are also known as Parsons‚Äô Problems. These are really helpful exercises for new programmers, because they allow you to focus just on the sequencing of the program, and not worry about the syntax (i.e. you don‚Äôt have to worry about making typos or remembering exactly how a program instruction is supposed to be written). Drag the blocks from the grey box on the left to the yellow box on the right, putting them in the correct order. Click the ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô button to test your solution.</paragraph>
<exercise label='pp_turtle_capital_L'   indentation='hide' language='python'><statement>
        <paragraph>The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital L as shown in the picture to the left of this text:</paragraph>

        <paragraph>But the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. Remember that the turtle starts off facing east when it is created. The turtle should turn to face south and draw a line that is 150 pixels long and then turn to face east and draw a line that is 75 pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the directions north, south, west, and east. Your program doesn‚Äôt neeed to draw the compass!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order. Then click on <emphasis>Check Me</emphasis> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>But the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up: import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the turtle. The turtle should turn to face southeast, draw a line that is 75 pixels long, then turn to face northeast, and draw a line that is 150 pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the directions north, south, west, and east. Northeast is between north and east. Southeast is between south and east.</paragraph>
