  <title>Data Types</title>
  <p>If you are not sure what type a value is, Python has a function called
            <term>type</term> which can tell you.</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type("Hello, World!"))
print(type(17))
print("Hello, World")
print(type(3.2))
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>We can also use this to find out about types that we use from imported modules, like the turtle module.</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle
win = turtle.Screen()
tammy = turtle.Turtle()
tammy.forward(100)
print(type(tammy))
print(type(win))
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>The output in the console shows that <c>tammy</c> is of type Turtle from the class turtle. And <c>win</c> is of type Screen from the class turtle.</p>
  <p>What about values like <c>"17"</c> and <c>"3.2"</c>? They look like numbers, but they
            are in quotation marks like strings.</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type("17"))
print(type("3.2"))
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>They're strings!</p>
  <p>Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (<c>'</c>) or double
            quotes (<c>"</c>), or three of each (<c>'''</c> or <c>"""</c>)</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(type('This is a string.'))
print(type("And so is this."))
print(type("""and this."""))
print(type('''and even this...'''))
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in <c>"Bruce's
beard"</c>, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside them, as in
            <c>'The knights who say "Ni!"'</c>.
            Strings enclosed with three occurrences of either quote symbol are called
            triple quoted strings.  They can contain either single or double quotes:</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"''')
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print("""This message will span
several lines
of the text.""")
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Python doesn't care whether you use single or double quotes or the
            three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings.  Once it has parsed the text of
            your program or command, the way it stores the value is identical in all cases,
            and the surrounding quotes are <term>not</term> part of the value that is stored.</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print('This is a string.')
print("""And so is this.""")
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>The Python language designers usually chose to surround their strings by
            single quotes.  What do you think would happen if the string already contained
            single quotes?</p>
  <p>When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between
            groups of three digits, as in <c>42,000</c>. This is not a legal integer in
            Python, but it does mean something else, which is legal:</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(42500)
print(42,500)
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Well, that's not what we expected at all! Because of the comma, Python chose to
            treat this as a <em>pair</em> of values. In fact, a print statement can print any number of values as long
            as you separate them by commas. Notice that the values are separated by spaces when they are displayed.</p>
  <program label="ac2_5_9" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(42, 17, 56, 34, 11, 4.35, 32)
print(3.4, "hello", 45)
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Remember not to put commas or spaces in your integers, no
            matter how big they are. Also revisit what we said in the previous chapter:
            formal languages are strict, the notation is concise, and even the smallest
            change might mean something quite different from what you intended.</p>
  <note>
    <p>The examples in this online text describe how print works in Python 3. If you install Python 2.7 on your machine, it will work slightly differently. One difference is that print is not called as a function, so there are no parentheses around the values to be printed. We recommend that you install Python 3.x, not the older Python 2 version.</p>

          <p>In Python variables are not declared. Values, not variables, have types in Python. A variable can even take on values with different types during a program's execution.</p>
