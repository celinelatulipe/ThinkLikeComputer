        <title>üê¢ Exploring the Turtle Module</title>
        <p>We already introduced the idea of drawing with turtles. In the next few sections we will delve more deeply into this fun module. The turtle module is designed to help students learning how to program explore programming concepts in a way that is visually fun and interesting. Using turtles also will allow us in later chapters to explore aspects of interactive programming. With turtles, there is a visual output that an end user can view and (as you learn more programming) interact with.</p>
        <p>Here is a turtle that starts to draw a dashed line:</p>

    <program label="ac3_11_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    
        <input>
import turtle             # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()      # creates a graphics window
maya = turtle.Turtle()    # create a turtle named maya

maya.forward(50)         # tell maya to move forward by 50 units
maya.penup()             # tell maya to pick up pen, so maya can move without drawing
maya.forward(25)          # move forward without drawing
maya.pendown()            # put the pen back down to draw
maya.forward(50)          # move forward by 50 units
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
        <p>Now that you know a bit more about Python, we can explain a bit more about what is going on here.</p>
        <p>Line 1 imports the Turtle module. This brings us two new <term>types</term> that we can use: the <c>Turtle</c> type, and the
            <c>Screen</c> type.</p>
        <p>On line 2, we create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would
            prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python
            simply a canvas), which we assign to variable <c>wn</c>. The dot notation <c>turtle.Screen</c> means <em>‚ÄúThe Screen type
                that is defined within the turtle module‚Äù</em>.  Every screen/window
            contains a <term>canvas</term>, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.</p>
        <p>In line 3 we create a turtle. Remember that Python is case
            sensitive, so the module name, <c>turtle</c>, with a lowercase <c>t</c>, is different from the
            type <c>Turtle</c> because of the uppercase <c>T</c>. The variable <c>maya</c> is made to refer to this
            turtle.</p>
        <p>These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.</p>
        <p>In lines 4-8, we instruct the turtle ‚Äòmaya‚Äô to draw part of a dashed line. Run the program and trace through lines 5-9 to understand what is happening. The turtle only leaves a trace when the tail (pen) is down. When you create a tutrle, their tail is down by default.</p>
        <note>
            <title>Complete the line ‚Ä¶</title>
            <p>Modify the program by adding the commands necessary to have <em>maya</em> make a dashed line that goes to the right edge of the canvas. The code will be repetitive. In the next chapter we will learn how to write this code so that it is more efficient!</p>

        <p>Maya the turtle is an <term>object</term> and once we have created a turtle object, we can make it perform actions. Objects have <term>methods</term>, things that they can do. We can make use of this by <term>invoking</term> or activating turtle <term>methods</term>. A method is a set of program instructions that are for a specific type of object. Turtle methods are sets of instrutcions that all turtles know how to respond to. Because maya is an object, we use dot notation to call or invoke the turtle methods; <c>maya.forward(50)</c> says to call the forward() method, for the turtle object maya, with the specific distance of 50 units.</p>
        <p>In addition to methods ‚Äî the things an object can do ‚Äî an object can also
            have <term>attributes</term> ‚Äî (sometimes called <em>properties</em>) which store information about the current state of an object. For example, each
            turtle has a <em>color</em> attribute. The method invocation  <c>maya.color("red")</c>
            will make maya red and the line that maya draws will be red too.</p>
        <p>The color of the turtle, the width of its pen(tail), the position of the turtle
            within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
            current <term>state</term>. Similarly, the window object has a background color which is part of its state.</p>
        <p>Quite a number of methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and
            window objects. In the example below, we show just a couple and have only commented
            those lines that are different from the previous example. Note also that we have decided
            to call our turtle object <em>tess</em>. When we create objects, we can call them whatever we want.</p>

    <program label="ac3_11_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    
        <input>
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")        # set the window background color

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")              # make tess blue
tess.pensize(3)                 # set the width of her pen

tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)

wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas
        </input>
<tests>


</tests>

    </program>
        <p>The last line plays a very important role. The wn variable refers to the window shown
            above. When we invoke its <c>exitonclick</c> method, the program pauses execution and waits for the user to click the mouse somewhere in the window.
            When this click event occurs, the response is to close the turtle window and
            exit (stop execution of) the Python program.</p>
        <p>Each time we run this program, a new drawing window pops up, and will remain on the
            screen until we click on it.</p>
        <note>
            <title>Extend this program ‚Ä¶</title>
            <p><ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Modify this program so that before it creates the window, it prompts
                        the user to enter the desired background color.It should store the
                        user‚Äôs responses in a variable, and modify the color of the window
                        according to the user‚Äôs wishes.
                        (Hint: you can find a list of permitted color names at
                        <url href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" visual="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp</url>. It includes some quite

                <li>
                    <p>Do similar changes to allow the user, at runtime, to set tess‚Äô color.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Do the same for the width of tess‚Äô pen. <em>Hint:</em> your dialog with the
                        user will return a string, but tess‚Äô <c>pensize</c> method
                        expects its argument to be an <c>int</c>. That means you need to convert
                        the string to an int before you pass it to <c>pensize</c>.</p>
