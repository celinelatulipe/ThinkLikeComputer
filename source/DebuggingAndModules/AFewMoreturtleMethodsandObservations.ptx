  <p>Here are a few more things that you might find useful as you write programs that use turtles.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances. So <c>tess.forward(-100)</c> will move
                    tess backwards, and <c>tess.left(-30)</c> turns her to the right. Additionally, because there
                    are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left will leave you facing in the same
                    direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation will differ, though
                    &#x2014; you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!)</p>
        <p>This suggests that we don't need both a left and a right turn method &#x2014; we could be
                    minimalists, and just have one method. There is also a <em>backward</em> method. (If you are
                    very nerdy, you might enjoy saying <c>alex.backward(-100)</c> to move alex forward!)</p>
        <p>Reviewing a few basic facts about geometry and number lines, like we've done here, is a
                    good start if we're going to play with turtles.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A turtle's pen can be picked up or put down. This allows us to move a turtle
                    to a different place without drawing a line. The methods are <c>up</c> and <c>down</c>.
                    Note that the methods <c>penup</c> and <c>pendown</c> do the same thing.</p>
        <program language="python">
          <input>
alex.up()
alex.forward(100)     # this moves alex, but no line is drawn
alex.down()
</input>
        </program>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Every turtle can have its own shape. The ones available <q>out of the box</q> are <c>arrow</c>,
                    <c>blank</c>, <c>circle</c>, <c>classic</c>, <c>square</c>, <c>triangle</c>, <c>turtle</c>.</p>
        <program language="python">
          <input>
...
alex.shape("turtle")
...
</input>
        </program>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can speed up or slow down the turtle's animation speed. (Animation
                    controls how quickly the turtle turns and moves forward). Speed settings can
                    be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest). But if you set the speed to 0,
                    it has a special meaning &#x2014; turn off animation and go as fast as possible.</p>
        <program language="python">
          <input>
alex.speed(10)
</input>
        </program>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A turtle can <q>stamp</q> its footprint onto the canvas, and this will remain after
                    the turtle has moved somewhere else. Stamping works even when the pen is up.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Let's do an example that shows off some of these new features. Note that the code below uses a for loop
            to make the turtle move repeatedly 30 times. We'll cover for loops in the next chapter.</p>
  <program label="ac3_14_1" interactive="activecode" language="python" codelens="no">
    <input>
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")
tess.shape("turtle")

dist = 5
tess.up()                     # this is new
for _ in range(30):    # start with size = 5 and grow by 2
    tess.stamp()                # leave an impression on the canvas
    tess.forward(dist)          # move tess along
    tess.right(24)              # and turn her
    dist = dist + 2

tess.color("red")
wn.exitonclick()
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>One more thing to be careful about. All except one of the shapes you see on the screen here are
            footprints created by <c>stamp</c>. After the loop, we change tess to be red, and that way you see where
            the actual turtle is (the red one is not a stamp - it's tess!).</p>

  <exercise label="pp3_14_1" indentation="hide" language="python">

      <p>But the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, set the shape to <q>turtle</q>, and pick up the pen.  Then the turtle should repeat the following ten times: go forward 50 pixels, leave a copy of the turtle at the current position, reverse for 50 pixels, and then turn right 36 degrees.  After the loop, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.</p>
