  <title>Function Definition</title>
  <p>The syntax for creating a named function, a <term>function definition</term>, is:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
def name( parameters ):
    statements
</input>
  </program>
  <p>You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that you can't use a name that is a Python
            keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers that were given previously. The parameters specify
            what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function. Another way to say this is that the
            parameters specify what the function needs to do its work.</p>
  <p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the <c>def</c>. In the
            examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the third of
            several <term>compound statements</term> we will see, all of which have the same pattern:</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A <term>body</term> consisting of one or more Python statements, each
                    indented the same amount &#x2013; <em>4 spaces is the Python standard</em> &#x2013; from
                    the header line.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We've already seen the <c>for</c> statement which has the same structure, with an indented block of code, and the
            <c>if</c>, <c>elif</c>, and <c>else</c> statements that do so as well.</p>
  <p>In a function definition, the keyword in the header is <c>def</c>, which is followed by the name of the function and
            some <em>parameter names</em> enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of
            parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.</p>
  <p>We will come back to parameters in Chapter 9. In this chapter we will focus on creating very simple functions that don't take any parameters. This way you can focus on understanding how to define and invoke (call) functions, and what happens when a function is executed.</p>
  <p>Here's the definition of a simple function, hello.</p>
  <program label="ac5_2_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def hello():
    """This function says hello and greets you"""
    print("Hello")
    print("Glad to meet you")
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <note>
    <title>docstrings</title>
    <p>If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that
                it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a <term>docstring</term>
                and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.</p>
    <p>Another way to retrieve this information is to use the interactive
                interpreter, and enter the expression <c>&lt;function_name&gt;.__doc__</c>, which will retrieve the
                docstring for the function.  So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is
                retrievable by python tools <em>at runtime</em>.  This is different from comments in your code,
                which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.</p>
    <p>By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of
                their functions.</p>
  </note>
  <p>By convention, function definitions go at the top of a file, after the import statements, but before any other code. You should always put your functions at the top like that. What is critical is that the Python interpreter needs to see the function definition before it sees any calls to that function. The example below doesn't work, because the function definition is <term>after</term> the function invocation.</p>
  <program label="ac5_2_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
goodbye()   # this won't work because the goodbye function isn't defined yet

def goodbye():
    """This function says goodbye and wishes you well"""
    print("Goodbye")
    print("We wish you all the best!")
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>Note that when you run the code above, the error you get is a NameError. The Python Interpreter has no idea what 'goodbye' is, because it hasn't seen anything with that name yet. Fix the code above so that it works.</p>
  <p>We can apply functions to make more interesting and complex turtle drawings.</p>
  <program label="ac5_2_3" interactive="activecode" language="python" codelens="no">
    <input>
import turtle

def draw_small_square():
  """Make turtle alex draw a square of with side 50."""

  for _ in range(4):
      alex.forward(50)
      alex.left(90)

def draw_big_square():
  """Make turtle alex draw a square of with side 100."""

  for _ in range(4):
      alex.forward(100)
      alex.left(90)

wn = turtle.Screen()      # Set up the window and its attributes
alex = turtle.Turtle()    # create alex
alex.speed(10)            # make alex draw fast

turn_angle = 15           # store a turn angle

for _ in range(12):       # loop 12 times to go around in a circle
  alex.color("red")
  alex.right(turn_angle) # turn by 15 degrees
  draw_big_square()      # Call the function to draw the big square

  alex.color("blue")
  alex.right(turn_angle) # turn by 15 degrees
  draw_small_square()      # Call the function to draw the small square

wn.exitonclick()
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
  <p>The above example has two different functions: <c>draw_small_square</c> and <c>draw_big_square</c>. In Chapter 9, when we talk about functions with parameters, we will show how to just have one function to draw a square of any size, by passing the length of the side in as a parameter.</p>
  <p>Each of the two functions has a <term>docstring</term> comment and then three lines of code, all indented. Make sure you know where the body of the function ends &#x2014; it depends on the indentation and the blank lines don't count for this purpose! This code example calls the two different square functions multiple times from within a for loop. Inside the for loop, we set the pen colour, change the turtle angle, call the function to draw a big square, then change the pen colour again, turn the turtle again, and call the function to draw a small square. The loop runs 12 times. In each loop iteration, the turtle turns a total of 30 degrees, so in total the turtle turns 360 degrees, completing a full revolution.</p>

  <exercise label="ac_5_2_4">
    <statement>
      <p>Write a turtle program that includes a function to draw a triangle (hint: to draw a triangle, turn the turtle 120 degrees three times). Then use a for loop to have a turtle draw five triangles to make a pattern like the one shown above. Turn the turtle each time in the for loop before calling the triangle function. How much to turn the turtle? Divide the number of degrees in a circle by the number of times you want to turn.</p>
