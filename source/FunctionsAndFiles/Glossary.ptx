      <title>compound statement</title>
      <p>A statement that consists of two parts:</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>header - which begins with a keyword determining the statement
                                    type, and ends with a colon.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>body - containing one or more statements indented the same amount
                                    from the header.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>The syntax of a compound statement looks like this:</p>
      <program language="python">
        <input>
keyword expression:
    statement
    statement
    ...
</input>
      </program>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>header line</title>
      <p>The first part of a compound statement. A header line begins with a keyword and
                            ends with a colon (:)</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>body</title>
      <p>The second part of a compound statement. The body consists of a
                            sequence of statements all indented the same amount from the beginning
                            of the header. The standard amount of indentation used within the
                            Python community is 4 spaces.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>function</title>
      <p>A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.
                            Functions may or may not take parameters and may or may not produce a
                            result.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>function definition</title>
      <p>A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name,
                            parameters, and the statements it executes.</p>
    </gi>
      <gi>
      <title>function invocation</title>
      <p>The act of calling a defined function, by referring to it's name followed by parentheses.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>global variable</title>
      <p>A variable defined at the top level, not inside any function.</p>
    </gi>
    
      <gi>
        <title>local variable</title>
        <p>A variable defined inside a function. A local variable can only be used
                              inside its function. Parameters of a function are also a special kind
                              of local variable.</p>
      </gi>
      <gi>
        <title>lifetime</title>
        <p>Variables and objects have lifetimes &#x2014; they are created at some point during
                              program execution, and will be destroyed at some time. In python, objects
                              live as long as there is some variable pointing to it, or it is part of some
                              other compound object, like a list or a dictionary. In python, local variables
                              live only until the function finishes execution.</p>
      </gi>
    

    <gi>
      <title>docstrings</title>
      <p>Similar to comments, docstrings are messages from the programmer to help another person understand what that function is doing. Indicated by three quotation marks.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>open</title>
      <p>You must open a file before you can read its contents.</p>
    </gi>
    
    <gi>
      <title>close</title>
      <p>When you are done with a file, you should close it.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>read</title>
      <p>Will read the entire contents of a file as a string.  This is often used in an assignment statement
                            so that a variable can reference the contents of the file.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>readline</title>
      <p>Will read a single line from the file, up to and including the first instance of the newline character.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>readlines</title>
      <p>Will read the entire contents of a file into a list where each line of the file is a string and is an element in the list.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>write</title>
      <p>Will add characters to the end of a file that has been opened for writing.</p>
