  <title>Reading a File</title>
  <p>As an example, suppose we have a text file called <c>olympics.txt</c> that contains
            information about olympians across different years. The contents of the file are shown at the bottom of this page.</p>
  <p>To open this file, we would call the <c>open</c> function. The variable,
            <c>fileref</c>, now holds a reference to the file object returned by
            <c>open</c>. When we are finished with the file, we can close it by using
            the <c>close</c> method. After the file is closed any further attempts to
            use <c>fileref</c> will result in an error.</p>
  <program label="ac5_7_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fileref = open("olympics.txt", "r")
## other code here that refers to variable fileref
fileref.close()
        </input>
    <tests>
    </tests>
  </program>
    <datafile xml:id="olympics_textfile" label="olympics.txt" filename="olympics.txt" hide="yes">
    <pre source="FunctionsAndFiles/TextFiles/olympics.txt"></pre>
    </datafile>
  <note>
    <p>A common mistake is to get confused about whether you are providing a variable name or a string literal as an input to the open function. In the code above, <q>olympics.txt</q> is a string literal that should correspond to the name of a file on your computer. If you put something without quotes, like <c>open(x, "r")</c>, it will be treated as a variable name. In this example, x should be a variable that's already been bound to a string value like <q>olympics.txt</q>.</p>
