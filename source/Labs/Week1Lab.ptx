            <title>Level 1 - Show IDLE is working on your computer </title>
        <p><ol>
            <li>
                <p>Follow the instructions on UMLearn in Week 0 – Programming Resources. Then watch the IDLE introduction movie and go on to complete the next step.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Launch IDLE:</p>
                <p>On a Mac, use spotlight (type command-space and then type IDLE) or find IDLE in your launchpad and double-click on it.</p>
                <p>On Windows, type IDLE in the Windows search bar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When IDLE opens, you are in the IDLE console. To make sure it is working, type the following: print(“Hello World”)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then in the upper left hand corner, click ‘File’, then ‘New File’ to open an empty file that you can then type, run, and save code. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now type the same code from Step 3 and then save this file with the name:  test.py</p>
                <p> <term> Pick a directory to save your .py files so in the future you can easily find them. </term> </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you open a new file, a ‘Run’ option should appear in your toolbar. Click it and then click ‘Run Module’.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Show your instructor that you have IDLE installed and working on your computer to get credit for Part 1. </p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>

                        <li>
                            <p>IDLE is a simple programming environment that comes with any Python 3.x installation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It offers a good way to test out syntax and see how a certain Python command works.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Typing code in IDLE is NOT the same thing as typing code in a file but it does offer the ability to create,        
                                edit and save Python programs as .py files.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When you create a Python program and save it as a .py file, you should run it to test it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The main assignments for this course require the submission of .py files on UMLearn.</p>
                        </li>

            <title>Level 2 - Write a turtle program </title>
            <note>
                <p> <term>Do NOT ever save one of your files as turtle.py</term> because this action will overwrite the turtle module and your turtle-based programs will stop working. </p>
            </note>
            <p><ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Open a new file in IDLE, then type in the following: </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>import turtle</p>
                    <p>wn = turtle.Screen()</p>
                    <p>niki = turtle.Turtle()</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Notice that the color of “import” is orange. This is called syntax highlighting which IDLE does to show that it recognizes certain Python commands. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add a few turtle movements to the above code and then save this program as lab_test.py</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Now click Run -> Run Module (or type F5) to run your program. This will open a new window with title of Python Turtle Graphics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Notice the three dark red >>> in IDLE which indicates that the program ran and is finished with IDLE ready to run another program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Edit your program so that your turtle draws a simple picture of a house ⌂ and save this file as house.py</p>
                    <p>If you get stuck, add the following code (with comments to describe what the code does):</p>
                    <p># draws bottom of house</p>
                    <p>niki.right(90)</p>

            <title>Level 3 - Type turtle program into IDLE</title>
            <p>In this last part, you will type your turtle program directly into the IDLE console, one line at a time. 
            This is a very different experience because IDLE interprets and executes each line after you hit ‘return’.</p>
                <p><ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the IDLE console, type “import turtle” then press enter. Python imported the turtle module and is now ready to accept the next command (see the >>>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Next type “wn = turtle.Screen() then press enter. Python creates and displays an empty turtle canvas and again the prompt >>> indicates that IDLE is ready for the next command. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now type “niki = turtle.Turtle() and press enter. Python creates a turtle and displays it at the x,y coordinate (0,0) which is the center of the canvas. Again the >>> prompt appears.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now make the turtle move with “niki.forward(100)”.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Notice that text entered into IDLE can’t be edited after the line of code has been executed when you press “enter”. Test this out by trying to change a line of code that you entered. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let’s say you were writing a program and you didn’t remember how Python handles mathematical order of operations (for example,  “4 + 8/2”). How is IDLE useful in this situation as compared to just typing the statement directly into you program file?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Show your instructor your IDLE console to demonstrate that you have tried the above commands for Steps 1 to 4 to get credit for Part 3.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol></p>
                <p>Congratulations you have completed your first lab writing Python code! 👏🎉🥳</p>
